## 🔍 About the Project

**XFlow** is a modular machine learning framework designed for training and evaluating models in structured research workflows. Originally built for image-based tasks in accelerator physics, it is flexible enough to generalize to broader deep learning applications.

> _Includes reusable modules for datasets, models, training loops, visualization, and logging._  
> _Current version: 0.1.0_

## ✨ Features

- Modular `core/` for dataset/model/trainer abstraction
- Plug-and-play task logic (`tasks/`)
- Built-in U-Net and ResNet models
- TensorFlow + custom trainer support
- Logging, metrics, and visualization helpers
- Clean `src/` layout with PyPI/pip support
